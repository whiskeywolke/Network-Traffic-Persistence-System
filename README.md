# A Lightweight Persistence System for Network Traffic Measurements

This repository holds the Implementation as well as the Paper I have written as my Bachelor Thesis for Computer Science.


## What is this Application?

This application is intended to capture and store network traffic at very high rates and to provide a structured query-able interface. 
It offers a 10x higher ingestion rate than specialized SQL-time-series databases do not offer sufficient performance for data center monitoring tasks.
The performance increase is achieved by domain specific optimizations.
